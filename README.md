# MongooseMeet - Event Management Platform API

> Scalable, Role-Based Event Management API built with MongoDB, Express, and Mongoose

A modern backend system for organizing, managing, and attending events. It handles authentication, role-based access, session scheduling, RSVP/waitlist handling, feedback, notifications, and logging — all while leveraging MongoDB's document strengths like subdocuments, virtuals, TTL indexes, and compound indexes.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Security

| Feature             | Implementation                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| JWT Auth            | Access + Refresh Tokens (securely stored/rotated) |
| Role-Based Access   | RBAC via middleware (requireRole)                 |
| Token Storage       | Refresh tokens stored in a separate collection    |
| Password Hashing    | bcryptjs inside Mongoose pre-hooks                |
| Security Middleware | Helmet, Rate-limiting, CORS                       |

### 👥 User & Role Management

- Register/Login with JWT-based sessions
- Roles like admin, organizer, attendee stored in Role model
- Profile update with role population
- Admin-only routes for managing users
- Soft delete supported

### 📅 Event & Session Management

- Events created by users (with createdBy ref)
- Each event has embedded sessions with title, speaker, timing, etc.
- Subdocuments used for sessions (inside Event model)
- Virtuals like totalDuration and numberOfSessions for analytics

### 📨 RSVP & Waitlist

- RSVP statuses: Going, Interested, Not Going
- One RSVP per user per event (compound index)
- Waitlist kicks in when event is full
- Prevents duplicate waitlist entries using (user, event) index

### 💬 Feedback System

- Users leave rating (1–5 stars) + comments on events
- Ratings validated inside schema
- Aggregation pipeline can be used for computing average rating per event

### 🔔 Notification System

- Notify users about RSVP confirmations, event changes, or waitlist moves
- `status` unread/read for UI display
- TTL index optional for old auto-deletion

### 📝 Audit Logging

- Each major action (event update, RSVP, etc.) is logged
- Manual logging using a reusable plugin (req.user passed)
- Fields logged: user, action, target model, timestamp

## 📡 API Authentication

All protected endpoints require a valid access token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>
```

Refresh tokens are stored securely and rotated for extended sessions.
